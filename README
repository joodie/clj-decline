Notes for release 0.0.2

Bugfix update

Notes for release 0.0.1

clj-decline is a validation library that hopefully will turn out to be
simple enough to be useful.

clj-decline does not place limits on what it can validate. It does not
restrict itself to web and will never do so. With regards to the kind
of rejection messages (errors) it can generate, the only restriction
is that they should be indexed by a key.

** This is still very much a work in progress - expect major breaking
changes in the next couple of releases **

To prevent havock, I won't be releasing SNAPSHOT releases. Instead,
there will as many minor releases as needed to push changes/fixes.
