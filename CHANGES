Bugfix release

Notes for release 0.0.1

clj-decline is a validation library that hopefully will turn out to be
simple enough to be useful.

clj-decline does not place limits on what it can validate. It does not
restrict itself to web and will never do so. With regards to the kind
of rejection messages (errors) it can generate, the only restriction
is that they should be indexed by a key.
