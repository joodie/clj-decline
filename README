clj-decline is a validation library that hopefully will turn out to be
simple enough to be useful.

clj-decline does not place limits on what it can validate. It does not
restrict itself to web and will never do so. With regards to the kind
of rejection messages (errors) it can generate, the only restriction
is that they should be indexed by a key.

Read the RANT for the long story.

For now, the functions are all documented inline, and the best place
to look for examples is the test code.

An online copy of the inline documentation is at

To prevent havock, I won't be releasing SNAPSHOT releases. Instead,
there will be as many minor releases as needed to push changes/fixes.

When updating to a new version, check the CHANGES file to see if
anything has changed in the API.

The releases are on clojars, so you can use your favorite build
tool. See http://clojars.org/clj-decline for the spec.
